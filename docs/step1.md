> *Scenario* You want to know the influence of tutoring on student test performance. To this end, you conduct a study involving 100 students. For each student, you collect data about their race, socioeconomic background, number of extra-curriculars, and test score. Additionally, you randomly assign each student to one of two tutoring conditions: online tutoring vs. in-person tutoring.

## Step 1: Declare variables 
There are two kinds of variables in rTisane: (i) Units and (ii) Measures. 


### Units (e.g., Participants)
Units are entities from which you collect data. Units are declared with the following: 
- `name`: character. Corresponds to the name of the column identifying each unit
- `cardinality`: int. The number of unique instances of a unit observed (e.g., the number of unique participants)

In the example, student is your unit. 
```R
student <- Unit(name="student", cardinality=100)
```

If you prefer to think about students as participants, not units, you can specify
```R
student <- Participant(name="student", cardinality=100)
```
Participant is an alias for Unit. *The above two declarations of `student` are equivalent.*


### Measures
Measures are attributes of a Unit you have directly observed and/or assigned them. There are three types of Measures. 

#### Categories
Categories can be unordered (e.g., race) or ordered (e.g., socioeconomic background). Categorical measures are declared with the following: 
- `unit`: Unit. The Unit the measure describes
- `name`: character. Column name
- `cardinality`: int. Number of unique categories. If `order` is provided, `cardinality` is not needed and will be set to the length of `order`
- `order`: list. List of categories in order from "lowest" to "highest"
- `baseline`: character. Specific category that the other categories in this measure are compared against. If `order` is provided, `baseline` is set to the lowest (left-most) value. Otherwise, by default, the first value in the dataset; `baseline` is useful for adding detail to conceptual relationships, through `when` and `then` parameters ([see below](#optional-when-and-then)).

In the scenario, race and tutoring are *unordered* categories: 
```R
race <- categories(
  unit=student, name="Race",
  cardinality=5, baseline="White")
tutoring <- categories(
  unit=student, name="Tutoring",
  cardinality=2, baseline="in-person")
```

In the scenario, socioeconomic background is an *ordered* category: 
```R
ses <- categories(
  unit=student, name="SES",
  order=list("lower", "middle", "upper"))
```

#### Counts
Counts measures are declared with the following: 
- `unit`: Unit. The Unit the measure describes
- `name`: character. Column name
- `baseline`: optional. By default, 0.

In the scenario, number of extra-curriculars is a count: 
```R 
extra <- counts(unit=student, name="Num Extra-curriculars")
```

#### Continuous (e.g., scores, temperature, time)
Continuous measures are declared with the following: 
- `unit`: Unit. The Unit the measure describes
- `name`: character. Column name
- `baseline`: optional. By default, 0.

In the scenario, test score is a continuous measure: 
```R 
testScore <- continuous(unit=student, name="Test score")
```
