# About

**rTisane is an interactive system for authoring statistical models from domain knowledge.** rTisane provides (i) a [domain-specific language](#rtisane-dsl) for expressing domain knowledge and (ii) an [interactive disambiguation process](#two-phase-interactive-disambiguation) for deriving an output statistical model. 

rTisane is designed for analysts who have domain expertise, are not statistical experts, and are comfortable with minimal programming (e.g., many researchers). 

*Scope of statistical models.* Currently, rTisane supports authoring generalized linear models. Our goal is to support increasingly complex research questions and hypotheses that may require more complex statistical models.

## What's the story behind the name?
rTisane sounds like "artisan" and "r Tisane." rTisane, implemented for the R progrmaming language, extends Tisane, which was built originally for Python.

## Development Team
[Eunice Jun](eunicemjun.com) leads development of rTisane with feedback from [Jeffrey Heer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/), [Rene Just](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/), and [Edward Misback](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xLxed_EAAAAJ&hl=en). Edward contributed to the tutorial. [Audrey Seo](https://audreyseo.github.io/) contributed significantly to the interactive disambiguation process. [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com/) named the system.
