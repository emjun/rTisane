# About

**rTisane is an interactive system for authoring statistical models from domain knowledge.** rTisane provides (i) a [domain-specific language](#rtisane-dsl) for expressing domain knowledge and (ii) an [interactive disambiguation process](#two-phase-interactive-disambiguation) for deriving an output statistical model. 

rTisane is designed for analysts who have domain expertise, are not statistical experts, and are comfortable with minimal programming (e.g., many researchers). 

*Scope of statistical models.* Currently, rTisane supports authoring generalized linear models. Our goal is to support increasingly complex research questions and hypotheses that may require more complex statistical models.

## What's the story behind the name?
rTisane sounds like "artisan" and "r Tisane." rTisane, implemented for the R progrmaming language, extends Tisane, which was built originally for Python.

## Development Team
Eunice Jun leads development of rTisane with feedback from Jeffrey Heer, Rene Just, and Edward Misback. Edward contributed to the tutorial. Audrey Seo contributed significantly to the interactive disambiguation process. Emery Berger named the system.
