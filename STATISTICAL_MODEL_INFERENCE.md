# Notes on the scope of statistical models inferred from a conceptual model 
rTisane programs "compile" to scripts that use [lme4 (and related libraries)](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) to fit statistical models. 

## How are confounders selected? 
We follow the guidelines from [Cinelli, Forney, and Pearl, 2022](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r493.pdf). I chose this because (i) it was more comprehensive, covering the guidelines in the modified disjunctive criteria; (ii) more directly appliable to our setting/how I am thinking about querying a conceptual model; and (iii) more recent.

This diverges from what Tisane implements, which is the [modified disjunctive criteria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-019-00494-6). 

To infer statistical models, we must infer confounders. To do so, we use all assumed and hypothesized relationships. This means that the confounders and statistical model are for the context of the causal graph/conceptual model specified.  

### Supported Family and Link functions
rTisane determines the family and link functions based on the variable data types. 

#### For continuous
Families supported: 
- Inverse Gaussian
- Gamma
- Gaussian

#### For counts
Families supported: 
- Poisson
- Negative Binomial

#### For categories
Families supported for **unordered categories**: 
- Binomial (when only two categories)
- Multinomial (when multiple categories)

Families supported for **ordered categories**: 
- Binomial (when only two categories)
- Multinomial (when multiple categories)
- Inverse Gaussian (when multiple categories)
- Gamma (when multiple categories)
- Gaussian (when multiple categories)

GLM in base R ([From reference](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/family))
Family: 
binomial
gaussian
Gamma
inverse.gaussian
poisson

Not currently supported in rTisane: 
quasi
quasibinomial (for modeling over-dispersion)
quasipoisson (for modeling over-dispersion)

Link functions: 
- binomial family: logit (logistic), probit (normal), cauchit (Cauchy), log and cloglog (complementary log-log)
- gaussian: identity, log, inverse
- Gamma:  inverse, identity, log
- inverse.gaussian: 1/mu^2, inverse, identity, log
- poisson: log, identity, sqrt

Not currently supported in rTisane: 
- quasi: logit, probit, cloglog, identity, inverse, log, 1/mu^2, sqrt (Can create power link function with `power` function)
- quasibinomial family: logit (logistic), probit (normal), cauchit (Cauchy), log and cloglog (complementary log-log)
- quasipoisson: log, identity, sqrt

<!-- GLMER in lme4 ([see lme4 reference](https://github.com/lme4/lme4/blob/master/src/glmFamily.h))

### Notes about code generation: 
- Negative Binomial: glm.nb, glmer.nb

### Programming idiom 
1. Create ConceptualModel 
2. Call updateGraph
3. Infer statistical model(s)
