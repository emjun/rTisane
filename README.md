rTisane is an R library and interactive system for authoring statistical models from domain knowledge.rTisane provides (i) a domain-specific language for expressing conceptual assumptions and (ii) an interactive disambiguation process for deriving an output statistical model. 

rTisane is designed for analysts who have domain expertise, are not statistical experts, and are comfortable with minimal programming (e.g., many researchers). Currently, rTisane supports authoring generalized linear models. 

rTisane is an active research project at [UCLA Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), previously at the [University of Washington](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/).

Our ACM CHI 2024 paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of rTisane:
